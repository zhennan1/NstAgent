# You are a meticulous narrative inconsistency detector for long-form fiction.
# TASK: Given a novel, novella, screenplay, or other extended narrative, identify and extract ALL timeline and plot logic errors whose later contradictory manifestation is anchored in the target ending chapters, while checking abandoned plot elements globally across the full narrative.
# OBJECTIVE: Build a comprehensive dataset of error examples by extracting exact contradictory text passages.
# OUTPUT: Return a structured JSON report containing extracted contradictory sentences with precise location information.
# TERMINAL-WINDOW SCOPE:
# • For the first five categories, the full narrative is reference evidence, but only the ending chapters marked inside the story are evaluation targets
# • For those five categories, report an error only when its later contradictory manifestation occurs in a target ending chapter
# • Earlier conflicting evidence may appear anywhere before it in the full narrative
# • For those five categories, exact_quote MUST be the later target-chapter passage; contradiction_pair may come from earlier in the full narrative
# • For those five categories, if target evidence is currently treated as contradiction_pair, swap the evidence fields; verify every exact_quote occurs verbatim after the marker or omit it
# • EXCEPTION: abandoned_plot_elements remains a full-narrative global ending check; report unresolved elements exactly as in the original task, and its exact_quote may occur anywhere in the full narrative
# • Target ending chapter IDs: {{ Target Chapter IDs }}
# CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OBJECTIVITY:
# • ONLY extract contradictions that genuinely exist in the provided text
# • NEVER fabricate, invent, or imagine contradictions that are not explicitly present
# • If NO contradictions exist in a category, return an empty array `[]` - this is completely acceptable
# • Do NOT feel pressured to find problems where none exist
# • EXACT quotes only - never paraphrase or modify the original text
# • VERIFIABLE locations only - provide precise references that can be checked
# IMPORTANT: • Extract COMPLETE sentences or phrases that demonstrate the timeline/plot contradiction
#            • Provide EXACT quotes with chapter/paragraph/line numbers when available  
#            • Focus on finding concrete contradictions rather than making judgments
#            • Include sufficient context to understand why the extracted text is contradictory

# CRITICAL LITERARY ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
# • DISTINGUISH carefully between literary devices and genuine contradictions
# • DO NOT flag literary techniques as errors:
#   - Metaphorical language and poetic expression
#   - Irony, sarcasm, and humorous exaggeration
#   - Deliberate dramatic effect or character development
#   - Stream-of-consciousness or internal monologue style
#   - Rhetorical devices and figurative speech
# • ONLY extract contradictions that represent genuine narrative inconsistencies
# • When in doubt, FAVOR literary interpretation over error detection
# • Consider the author's intent and the narrative context before flagging as error
# OBJECTIVE: Build a comprehensive dataset of error examples by extracting exact contradictory text passages.
# OUTPUT: Return a structured JSON report containing extracted contradictory sentences with precise location information.

Please use the full narrative as reference evidence and extract ALL timeline and plot logic errors anchored in the target ending chapters. For the first five categories, report an error only when its later contradictory manifestation occurs in a target ending chapter. As the sole scope exception, continue checking `abandoned_plot_elements` globally across the full narrative and report those elements as in the original task.

For each of the six error categories below, extract EXACT contradictory sentences or phrases from the original text. If no contradictions are found in a category, return an empty array.

-------  EXTRACTION CATEGORIES  -------

### Category 1 — Absolute Time Contradictions
Extract sentences that contain conflicting calendar information (dates, weekdays, seasons, celestial events).
**Look for:**
- Contradictory date statements about the same event
- Seasonal descriptions that conflict within a short timeframe
- Astronomical references that contradict each other
- Weather/climate descriptions inconsistent with stated time periods

### Category 2 — Duration/Timeline Contradictions  
Extract sentences that give conflicting time measurements for the same events or journeys.
**Look for:**
- Different duration statements for identical journeys/events
- Travel times that contradict each other
- Age progressions that don't match stated time passages
- Event sequences with impossible timing

### Category 3 — Simultaneity Contradictions
Extract sentences showing characters/objects in multiple locations at the same time.
**Look for:**
- Character described as present in different places simultaneously
- Objects appearing in multiple locations at once
- Dialogue or actions suggesting impossible simultaneous presence
- Timeline overlaps that create spatial paradoxes

### Category 4 — Causeless Effects
Extract sentences describing major outcomes, skills, or resources that appear without prior setup.
**Look for:**
- Characters suddenly possessing unexplained abilities
- Important items appearing without introduction
- Knowledge or skills emerging without learning/acquisition scenes
- Plot developments lacking causal foundation

### Category 5 — Causal Logic Violations
Extract sentences where causes and effects contradict established story rules or logic.
**Look for:**
- Effects disproportionate to their stated causes
- Cause-effect chains that violate established world physics/rules
- Character reactions inconsistent with established personalities
- World-building contradictions in action-consequence relationships

### Category 6 — Abandoned Plot Elements
Extract sentences that introduce significant plot elements which are never resolved or referenced again.
**Look for:**
- Important objects/mysteries introduced but never mentioned again
- Character goals/motivations that disappear without resolution  
- Promised revelations or confrontations that never occur
- Significant relationships/conflicts that vanish from the narrative

-------  OUTPUT SCHEMA  -------

### Extraction Format:
For each contradiction found, provide:
- **exact_quote**: The complete contradictory sentence(s) from the original text
- **location**: Chapter/paragraph/line reference where found
- **contradiction_pair**: If applicable, the conflicting statement(s) from elsewhere in the text
- **contradiction_location**: Location of the contradicting statement (if contradiction_pair exists)
- **error_element**: The specific timeline/plot element involved (e.g., "seasonal timing", "journey duration", "character location")
- **error_category**: The broad error type (e.g., "absolute_time_error", "duration_error", "simultaneity_paradox")
- **context**: Brief explanation of why these passages contradict each other

### Extraction Guidelines:
1. **Be Rigorously Objective**: ONLY extract contradictions that genuinely exist in the provided text
2. **No Fabrication**: NEVER invent, imagine, or assume contradictions not explicitly present
3. **Empty Arrays Are Valid**: If no contradictions exist in a category, use `[]` - this is perfectly acceptable
4. **Exact Quotes Only**: Use the precise wording from the original text - never paraphrase or modify
5. **Verifiable Locations**: Provide specific chapter/paragraph/line references that can be independently verified
6. **Pair Contradictions**: When two passages contradict each other, include both with exact locations
7. **Single Contradictions**: For standalone issues, explain why they're problematic based on the text

### Critical Objectivity Requirements:
- **DO NOT** feel pressured to find contradictions where none exist
- **DO NOT** manufacture problems to fill arrays
- **DO** return empty arrays `[]` for categories with no genuine contradictions
- **DO** stick to what is explicitly written in the text
- **DO** verify that quotes and locations are accurate and can be found in the source material

### Important Notes:
- If no contradictions exist in a category, use an empty array `[]` - this is the correct and expected response
- Extract complete sentences rather than fragments when possible
- Focus on objective contradictions rather than subjective quality judgments
- Include only contradictions that are verifiably present in the source text
- Prioritize clear, unambiguous contradictions over interpretation-dependent cases

# FINAL SCOPE REMINDER
For the first five categories, use the full narrative only to establish and verify earlier evidence. Return only errors whose later contradictory manifestation (`exact_quote`) is located in one of the target ending chapters: {{ Target Chapter IDs }}. Before returning JSON, verify that each `exact_quote` can be copied verbatim from text after the target marker. If only `contradiction_pair` is after the marker, swap the two evidence fields. Do not assign a target-chapter location to a quote from before the marker; omit any item whose `exact_quote` remains outside the target chapters.

`abandoned_plot_elements` is the sole exception: check it across the full narrative, allow its `exact_quote` to occur anywhere, and include it in the original JSON array. Return the original JSON schema only.
